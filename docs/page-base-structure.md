## Base Structure

This is the base structure for any new page that is to be created

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <!-- Include The Head here -->
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The navigation comes after -->
    <div class="site-navigation">...</div>
    <!-- The content for that particular page follows -->
    <!-- The footer is always at the end -->
    <footer>...</footer>
    <!-- scripts are always at the bottom -->
    <script src="./js/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
